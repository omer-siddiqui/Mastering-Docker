# Docker Compose 

Welcome to the Docker Compose Tutorial! This guide accompanies a video tutorial on Docker Compose available on the [Mastering Cloud](https://youtu.be/WV6SnFMYM1w) YouTube channel.

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It uses a simple YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services, networks, and volumes, making it easier to run and scale applications with multiple Docker containers.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Docker concepts
- Docker Compose installed (usually included with Docker)

  ## Install docker compose

  cd to /usr/local/bin

  google docker compose github -> releases -> linux x86 64 -> copy link

  wget paste it

  mv docker-compose file to compose -> chmod 777 compose

  compose --version

  check again from root directory -> cd -> compose --versioin

  ## to run multiple docker file at once

  docker compose up -d
